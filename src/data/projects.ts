    shortDescription:
      "A .NET solution implementing clean architecture with CQRS, domain events, RabbitMQ integration, and MongoDB synchronization.",
    fullDescription: `
    This project implements an order management system using .NET and follows the Clean Architecture pattern.
    It exposes three REST API endpoints: Get Orders, Get Order by ID, and Create Order.
    The Create Order endpoint triggers a CQRS command handler that performs business validations such as inventory checks,
    persists the order to a SQL Server database, and then publishes an OrderCreatedEvent domain event.
    An event handler listens for this event and publishes a message to a RabbitMQ queue.
    A separate Consumer worker application listens to this RabbitMQ queue, reads the order data from the SQL database,
    and synchronizes it to a MongoDB collection.
    Additionally, there is a Migration Runner console application that performs initial data seeding.
    The entire solution is containerized using Docker with separate Dockerfiles for the API, Consumer, and Migration Runner apps.
    MongoDB, SQL Server, and RabbitMQ services are orchestrated using Docker Compose.
